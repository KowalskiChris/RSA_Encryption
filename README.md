# RSA Encryption
An implementation of the RSA encryption algorithm for public key cryptography.

## Features
- Generate and distribute RSA encryption keys.
- Encode messages using ASCII encoding.
- Encrypt and send messages using public keys.
- Decrypt and decode received messages using private keys.

## Requirements
This project requires the following Python libraries to help generate large prime numbers:
- `sympy`
- `random`
